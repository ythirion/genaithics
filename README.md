# What are the genaithics code?
A genaithics code is information that a content creator chooses to add to their digital file to inform their audience about the extent of generative AI (“gen AI”) involvement during the creation process.

# The genaithics codes
There are currently 4 genaithics codes available, either as a ![badge](https://github.com/Mathieu-genAI/genaithics/tree/main/img) or as text.

| badge     | text     | description     |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| ![genaithics-H-Z](https://github.com/Mathieu-genAI/genaithics/blob/main/img/genaithics_code_H-Z_208x100.png)    | `genaithics-H-Z`     | Zero IA used. 100% human based creation.|
| ![genaithics-H-1-HZ](https://github.com/Mathieu-genAI/genaithics/blob/main/img/genaithics_code_H-1-H_208x100.png)    | `genaithics-H-1-H`     | IA used for small and **minor corrections**. <br>**Final validation finale done by human.**|
| ![genaithics-H-2-H](https://github.com/Mathieu-genAI/genaithics/blob/main/img/genaithics_code_H-2-H_208x100.png)    | `genaithics-H-2-H`     | AI used to improve **form and structure**, without altering content, intent or meaning. <br>**Final validation finale done by human**.|
| ![genaithics-3-H](https://github.com/Mathieu-genAI/genaithics/blob/main/img/genaithics_code_3-H_208x100.png)    | `genaithics-3-H`     | Content produced entirely by an AI, supervised by a human via “prompts”.<br>**Final validation done by human**.|

_If in doubt, check the examples provided… and remember, if you’re unsure between two genaithics codes: <br>***the most important thing is transparency with your audience, which will make your approach ethical and responsible.***_

## How to use genaithics codes?

### Source code files
- Add the genaithics code genaithics as text in the headers comments.

### Office documents
- Add the badge in the header, footer or cover page.
- Add the text mention in the metadata.

### Photos, images, graphic illustrations
- Add the text mention in the metadata.

### Videos
- At a minimum: add the text mention in the metadata.
- Add the badge at the end of the video (or as an overlay during the video if possible).

### Audios files
- Add the text mention in the metadata.

# KISS
Keep It Sweet and Simple! 
No matter how many iterations and loops there are between the human and the AI in the creation process: what matters is transparency.
The genaithics codes are designed to address a central concern in organizations: enhancing transparency and building lasting trust, both internally and externally, when content is produced (or modified) with the help of generative AI. ***Don’t make your workload heavier than necessary—use the genaithics codes when you think it’s important***.
